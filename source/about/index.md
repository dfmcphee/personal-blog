> Hi, my name is Dominic.

You can call me Dom. Not to be confused with the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) of course.

I am a Front End Developer at Shopify in Ottawa, Canada. I work in the UX department to help build and maintain our admin interface design system.

In my spare time I enjoy hacking on code, taking photos, playing board games, or noodling on my guitar (or uke).

You can also find me [tweeting](https://twitter.com/dfmcphee) about things, or sharing photos I have taken on the [gram](https://www.instagram.com/dfmcphee/).
